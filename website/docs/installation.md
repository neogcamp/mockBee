# Installation

Getting started with mockBee is easy! 🏄‍♂️

## Scaffolding your Project

### Step 1: Cloning the Repo

Run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neogcamp/mockBee.git
```

This will clone the repository as `mockBee` folder on your local.

### Step 2: Choose your project

Copy the folder of the project whose APIs you want to use to your desired location.

> For example, for making `e-commerce` app; you can copy the **e-commerce folder** (`mockBee/e-commerce`) and get started.

If you don't intend to use other APIs of the repository; you can safely delete `mockBee` folder.

### Step 3: Installing

In the Project Folder, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
// or
yarn
```

You will see the npm dependencies get installed. Now let us get the app running!

### Step 4: Running the App

```bash
npm start
// or
yarn start
```

This should run the **react app** on `localhost:3000`
